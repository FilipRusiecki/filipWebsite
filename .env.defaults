# These environment variables will be used by default if you do not create any
# yourself in .env. This file should be safe to check into your version control
# system. Any custom values should go in .env and .env should *not* be checked
# into version control.

# IMPORTANT: For production (Vercel), you must set DATABASE_URL in your .env file
# pointing to your Vercel Postgres (or other PostgreSQL) instance.
# For local development, you can use a local PostgreSQL instance.

# Example PostgreSQL URL (for local development):
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/filipwebsite?schema=public
